This is a repository that contains how to prevent against the length extension attacks on sha1.
info on - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_extension_attack (to actually see it in play use hashpumpy py lib or the tol hashpump itself)
info on the library used - https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html

the code adheres to my knowledge of working against such attacks.
the use of this code in any environement and then getting flagged for any reason is not my responsibility as this code is for learning purposes only.
